## Commandline usage

Run it inside a repository with a `README.md`:

```sh
lychee README.md
```

You can also specify various types of inputs:

```sh
# check links on a website:
lychee https://endler.dev/

# check links in a remote file:
lychee https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lycheeverse/lychee/master/README.md

# check links in local file(s):
lychee README.md
lychee test.html info.txt

# check links in local files (by shell glob):
lychee ~/projects/*/README.md

# check links in local files (lychee supports advanced globbing and ~ expansion):
lychee "~/projects/big_project/**/README.*"

# ignore case when globbing and check result for each link:
lychee --glob-ignore-case --verbose "~/projects/**/[r]eadme.*"

# check links from epub file (requires atool: https://www.nongnu.org/atool)
acat -F zip {file.epub} "*.xhtml" "*.html" | lychee -

# check links in directory; block network requests
lychee --offline path/to/directory
```

### GitHub token

Optionally, to avoid getting rate-limited while checking GitHub links, you can
set an environment variable with your Github token like so `GITHUB_TOKEN=xxxx`,
or use the `--github-token` CLI option. It can also be set in the config file.
[Here is an example config file][config file].

The token can be generated in your
[GitHub account settings page](https://github.com/settings/tokens). A personal
token with no extra permissions is enough to be able to check public repos links.

### Commandline Parameters

There is an extensive list of commandline parameters to customize the behavior,
see below for a full list.

```ignore
USAGE:
    lychee [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <inputs>...

FLAGS:
        --dump                   Don't perform any link checking. Instead, dump all the links extracted from inputs that
                                 would be checked
    -E, --exclude-all-private    Exclude all private IPs from checking.
                                 Equivalent to `--exclude-private --exclude-link-local --exclude-loopback`
        --exclude-link-local     Exclude link-local IP address range from checking
        --exclude-loopback       Exclude loopback IP address range and localhost from checking

    -i, --insecure               Proceed for server connections considered insecure (invalid TLS)
    -n, --no-progress            Do not show progress bar.
                                 This is recommended for non-interactive shells (e.g. for continuous integration)
        --offline                Only check local files and block network requests
        --require-https          When HTTPS is available, treat HTTP links as errors
        --skip-missing           Skip missing input files (default is to error if they don't exist)
    -V, --version                Prints version information
    -v, --verbose                Verbose program output

OPTIONS:
    -a, --accept <accept>                      Comma-separated list of accepted status codes for valid links
    -b, --base <base>                          Base URL or website root directory to check relative URLs e.g.
                                               https://example.org or `/path/to/public`
        --basic-auth <basic-auth>              Basic authentication support. E.g. `username:password`
    -c, --config <config-file>                 Configuration file to use [default: ./lychee.toml]
        --exclude <exclude>...                 Exclude URLs from checking (supports regex)
        --exclude-file <exclude-file>...       A file or files that contains URLs to exclude from checking
    -f, --format <format>                      Output file format of status report (json, string) [default: string]
        --github-token <github-token>          GitHub API token to use when checking github.com links, to avoid rate
                                               limiting [env: GITHUB_TOKEN=]
    -h, --headers <headers>...                 Custom request headers
        --include <include>...                 URLs to check (supports regex). Has preference over all excludes
        --max-concurrency <max-concurrency>    Maximum number of concurrent network requests [default: 128]
    -m, --max-redirects <max-redirects>        Maximum number of allowed redirects [default: 10]
    -X, --method <method>                      Request method [default: get]
    -o, --output <output>                      Output file of status report
    -s, --scheme <scheme>...                   Only test links with the given schemes (e.g. http and https)
    -T, --threads <threads>                    Number of threads to utilize. Defaults to number of cores available to
                                               the system
    -t, --timeout <timeout>                    Website timeout from connect to response finished [default: 20]
    -u, --user-agent <user-agent>              User agent [default: lychee/0.7.2]

ARGS:
    <inputs>...    The inputs (where to get links to check from). These can be: files (e.g. `README.md`), file globs
                   (e.g. `"~/git/*/README.md"`), remote URLs (e.g. `https://example.org/README.md`) or standard
                   input (`-`). NOTE: Use `--` to separate inputs from options that allow multiple arguments
```

### Exit codes

- `0` for success (all links checked successfully or excluded/skipped as configured)
- `1` for missing inputs and any unexpected runtime failures or config errors
- `2` for link check failures (if any non-excluded link failed the check)

## Library usage

You can use lychee as a library for your own projects.
Here is a "hello world" example:

```rust
use lychee_lib::Result;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
  let response = lychee_lib::check("https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee").await?;
  println!("{}", response);
  Ok(())
}
```

This is equivalent to the following snippet, in which we build our own client:

```rust
use lychee_lib::{ClientBuilder, Result, Status};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
  let client = ClientBuilder::default().client()?;
  let response = client.check("https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee").await?;
  assert!(response.status().is_success());
  Ok(())
}
```

The client builder is very customizable:

```rust, ignore
let client = lychee_lib::ClientBuilder::builder()
    .includes(includes)
    .excludes(excludes)
    .max_redirects(cfg.max_redirects)
    .user_agent(cfg.user_agent)
    .allow_insecure(cfg.insecure)
    .custom_headers(headers)
    .method(method)
    .timeout(timeout)
    .github_token(cfg.github_token)
    .scheme(cfg.scheme)
    .accepted(accepted)
    .build()
    .client()?;
```

All options that you set will be used for all link checks.
See the [builder documentation](https://docs.rs/lychee-lib/latest/lychee_lib/struct.ClientBuilder.html) for all options.
For more information, check out the [examples](examples) folder.

## GitHub Action usage

A GitHub Action that uses lychee is available as a separate repository: [lycheeverse/lychee-action](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee-action)
which includes usage instructions.

## Contributing to lychee

We'd be thankful for any contribution. \
We try to keep the issue-tracker up-to-date so you can quickly find a task to work on.

Try one of these links to get started:

- [good first issues](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
- [help wanted](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)

Lychee is written in Rust. Install [rust-up](https://rustup.rs/) to get started.
Begin by making sure the following commands succeed without errors.

```bash
cargo test # runs tests
cargo clippy # lints code
cargo install cargo-publish-all
cargo-publish-all --dry-run --yes # dry run release
```

## Debugging and improving async code

Lychee makes heavy use of async code to be resource-friendly while still being performant.
Async code can be difficult to troubleshoot with most tools, however.
Therefore we provide experimental support for [tokio-console](https://github.com/tokio-rs/console).
It provides a top(1)-like overview for async tasks!

If you want to give it a spin, download and start the console:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tokio-rs/console
cd console
cargo run
```

Then run lychee with some special flags and features enabled.

```sh
RUSTFLAGS="--cfg tokio_unstable" cargo run --features tokio-console -- <input1> <input2> ...
```

If you find a way to make lychee faster, please do reach out.
